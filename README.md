## Who We Are

Horizon isn't just a club — it's a **launchpad for future cloud architects**, developers, and builders who actually want to understand how modern tech works under the hood. We're a crew of curious minds obsessed with breaking down real cloud systems — from AWS and Azure to Google Cloud — and learning how they power the products people use every day.

Our focus is simple: turn raw ambition into real-world skills. No surface-level theory, no copy-paste tutorials. Just hands-on learning, meaningful collaborations, and projects that ship, scale, and solve real problems.

Whether you're chasing certifications, deploying your first production app, contributing to open-source, or just figuring out where cloud fits into your future, Horizon gives you the space, people, and momentum to grow.

## What We Do

At Horizon, we don't just talk tech — we **live it**. Everything we do is built around learning by actually doing:

- **Deep-dive workshops** on cloud services
- **Certification sprints** to help you get AWS, Azure, and GCP certified
- **Hands-on projects** that put your skills to the test
- **Collaborative builds** where everyone ships and everyone learns

You'll get hands-on with real systems — building them, breaking them, debugging the mess, and rebuilding them better. The goal is simple: take you from **cloud curious** to **cloud certified**, confident enough to build on your own.
